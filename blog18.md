## Footprinting


When it comes to penetration testing and target fingerprints, the goal is to determine what information is publicly available on your target. This is information that is available on the Internet, e.g. B. network architecture, operating systems, applications or users. This is passive in that, as a pen tester, you have tried every possible way to find hosts or networks. It could be one of them, but you should collect as much information as you can in every possible way. possible before proceeding to the next stageIf you find sensitive information on a publicly accessible website or location, that information should be reported to the organization in your report. When you find information that you think is critical and you think you shouldn't wait a month. or even a week before submitting the full report, you want to notify your emergency contact immediately. This stage of the attack should help prevent information leaks and assist you with social engineering attempts. Let's see the details.The first thing you can do is get the right clearance, and it will be whoever is in charge. It may or may not include system administrators.

## Utilities to perform footprinting

Companies often need to know how their system administrators behave. After going through this process, you need to make sure that you define the area. The prerequisite is the restriction of the scope of the penetration test. When you go through this phase, you will be able to configure the list of items to be tested. For example; What are the IP ranges or subnet ranges of the systems or what are their limitations? Now that you've defined your area, you need to use your discovery tools to plan and collect information about that area.Engines like Google, Bing or Yahoo whatever you need to use to see what information is currently available. You can also check some other specific websites like social media sites like Facebook and see if there is a Facebook Page or Twitter account. . for the company. Next, you need to see who is friends with this company as you can find existing employees there and see if you can step down from there. After you've scoured the search engines, it is a good idea to try to see if you can hack them from Google.You can do this by using additional tools that give you a graphical user interface like SiteDigger or Google's Hacking Database. Google hacking can help you find resources that have been crawled by the Google search engine that businesses may not know are listed there. B. Printers or cameras that can give you an idea of what IP addresses are available or what machine they have. The next step after the Google hack is to search for social networks like Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn. on the social media level to keep your guardsIt's easy to see what people are talking about, but initial conversations with users or staff can be a great way to gather info.

## Social engineering as part of the footprinting process

It's easy not to see what people are talking about, but initial conversations with users or co-workers could be a great way to gather information. an existing employee and say, "Hi, it sounds like you have a great company and I've been thinking about joining the IT team. What kind of equipment are you using there? The next step is to get one Make names the websites and you are going to dothan with BlackWidow or Web Site Copier. With this tool, you need to download the website first to view it offline and view the code. You need to remember that all you see in a web interface are downloaded files. So are you downloading an exact copy of this website so you can see what they're doing in the back end, especially when they're making front to back calls?You can then search for email fingerprints. There are some great tools that you can use to do this for you, such as: For example, use the nslookup command to find out the DNS names and IP addresses of your  Some of the information you can get. Outside of email, it includes the encryption they use and other services that can be used in conjunction with their email environment. You can also find out how they host email servers or which hosting providers they use. You can then create some competitive information.Competitive intelligence is the way most companies get to know their competitors. Attackers can use the same resources to find out what people are doing, and it's also a great way for companies to find out what projects their competitors are currently working  you will need to do a whois check so you can find out who owns the IP address range or your domain. To do this, you can use tools like Domain Dossier or SmartWhois. Sometimes these tools also do a necessary enumeration based onDNS, this is your next step. For DNS discovery you can use tools like Sam Spade or DNSstuff, but you can always use the nslookup command, which is very powerful. One of the reasons you need to do a DNS handshake is so that you can discover key hosts on the network that you can then use for social engineering attacks or during a DNS poisoning attack. 

## Your toolset for performing reconaissance
The next step is to conduct a network investigation. To do this, you need to use different types of tools such as: For example, Path Analyzer Pro, which shows you the path of a packet, or Network Pinger or the VisualRoute tool, which you can use to get more information. These will help you draw a better diagram to deal with. You should also try a social engineering attack that involves "surfing" to see if you can gather information by watching what people are doing. Technical attacks also include dumpster diving or diving. Listen. This allows you to collect information such as the company security products you use, operating systems, software versions, network layout, IP addresses, or the names of their  You should be sure to document everything you find. This is because you must use this document and any information you have gathered to understand and analyze the security posture of your target. You will be amazed at the information you can extract from what you are extracting using this method.This is why it is so important to spend as much time here as possible so that you can create a card with all of your other tasks.  If you want to scan your target device, you need to find this out. which systems are active in the network and how often they are active in the network. Are they only active at certain times? You also need to determine the ports that are currently open on these nodes, as well as the services thatEach of these things can help you determine if there are any vulnerabilities to track on your target  Another way to scan the web is to see if you can grab banners. This process tells you which ports you want to close, and if there are banners, you can hide or customize them. Also, you need to see which services you don't want, and if not, they need to be activated. turn off.This also gives you an idea of ​​how to standardize the rules of your firewall and intrusion detection system. You will also see the misconfiguration vector and what you want to do to correct those misconfigurations. Host discovery that recognizes hosts that are active in the target network. There are numerous tools that you can use. Some of them are based on the user interface and some are based on the command line. For example, the Nmap tool analyzes the DOS command environment or the command-only environment. There are other tools as well, but these are the most popular. These tools are not intended to be misleading. But you can also use them like that. Once you've compiled a list of the nodes that are active on the network, your next goal is to perform a port scan. You can find out which ports are open by running a port scan. The attacker can install or exploit malware on a systemspecific vulnerabilities. You should therefore always check which ports are open and include them in your report if they do not need to be open. Some tools that you can use are "nmap", which I talked about before, but you need to understand that some of these tools are multi-purpose tools. Another tool you can use is called "NetScanTools Pro". You may have other tools that you prefer, but you need to choose one and master how to use it.In the meantime, it's nice to get in touch with other tools as well, and not just because of your experience or résumé, but for other reasons as well. For example, if you use these tools, you will find that each of these software has certain limitations. and while one of them is doing a job, the other can help you do another job better.

Thank you!
